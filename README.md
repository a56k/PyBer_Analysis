Ride Sharing Analysis by City Type, ride, etc

## The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. 

        The PyBer analysis project focused on data visualization to provide a better overview of its strategy to expand its ride-sharing services. 
        
        With the final results and recommendations designed for an executive audience, the sorted data from the CSV files helped a more statistical analysis to obtain central tendencies measure and compare them by each city and estimate the feasibility of their forecast based on affordability of its services.

## Results:

    The shown in the summary figure from the analysis file (see link below), gives us the Final Results for all calculations and research done in this Analysis.

    More importantly, we have collected, and combined data from all three cities compared the fares by measuring their means, median, and mode - which helped establish which city charged the most; the frequency of rides, and the amount of rides for each type of cities.  

    Plus, we capture the trends in different months of the year,  underlined the most significant changes occurring - which will be quite important if we were to  explain any seasonality, if any, that exist for these three cities.

    Brief, the summary graph shows similar linear trends for all three cities. The most significant variance occurs in February and March for all three cities. "Suburban" city experiences the most significant peak, as well as the sharpest drop, respectively,  in fares ($) as compare to its counterpart. However, "Suburban" city seems to price higher fares in ($) for a more extended time toward the end of April, as the other two towns remain constant.

## Recommendations

    1- The best area to focus their ride-sharing service is "Urban" - even with no significant changes over time, the company certainly can count on a constant inflow of revenue.
    
    2- Increase the fares for Rural areas, especially on the 1st weekend of each month - as the data shows the trend for the usage of the ride-sharing peak. More analysis will be required to verify the few months where this phenomenon did not occur. 
    
    3- Understand the root cause for certain fares that occur more constantly than others. We saw the mode in specific data arrays to be quite repetitive when we calculated the summary statistics. Thus, I would cluster those customers and find ways to make them repetitive riders - They seem to be sharing similar attributes.
